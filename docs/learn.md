## Why standards?
The open-source community is huge, we all come from different places from different backgrounds, with different ways to resolve problems.

In this new era where collaboration is a big part of being able to come to the best possible solution, having standards that could help us all have common ground on how to resolve certain problems sounds like a basic requirement.

Being able to create something that followed pre-established conventions we can all agree on basically helps us:

* measure quality in some way;
* in case of software development, standards would assist a developer in understanding what a piece of software provides in order to facilitate usage;
* provide an understandable and universally accepted way to collaborate on any type of project;
* promote a healthy way to extend any project when collaboration guidelines are followed;
* and bring up to speed newcomers to a project being able to ramp up reading applied standards.

## What is a standard?
Generally, **a standard is a common format accepted and used by a group of people which promotes interoperability** so that when a project complies with a standard, anyone knows what to expect from it. The level of commitment with a standard provides certain assurance to others and are commonly mandatory to comply with.

On the other hand, it's worth mentioning what a guideline is in order to compare concepts. Guidelines constitutes a **piece of advice on how to act in a given situation**, they are not mandatory and can't be fully measured as they provide take it or leave it suggestions.

For this initiative, **no project will be forced to comply with any standard**; it's not mandatory but recommended. This is because the whole idea behind this initiative is to provide a tool that we can all contribute freely and see value in it. Eventually it may happen that the community pushes everyone to comply with them, but that needs to happen naturally to avoid any strong feelings.

Also, **a standard need to define at least certain mandatory rules to be applied aside from optional ones**. Otherwise it will end up defining guidelines that can’t be really verified that they were applied as part of the complying process.

## Where does standards live?
This initiative strongly relies on GitHub capabilities, such like Issues, Releases and README files. That’s because GitHub hosts the largest number of open-source projects represented by a GitHub repository of files that also relies on the same GitHub capabilities. 

Specifically, **a standard is represented by a repository in the Standards organization** which includes markdown files with at least a README.md file to describe the standard purpose among other topics. Within that repository, **a standard uses the Issues GitHub capability to bring everyone together in discussion** about the standard itself and to request the standard’s maintainers to validate certain project complies with it. Also, **a standard necessarily needs to release new versions when it gets updated using GitHub Releases** in order to keep track its evolution and to identify if projects complies with the latest version.

As mentioned, a repository needs to follow certain rules to be able to create a complete and usable standard. Well, that sounded like a whole standard by itself so it made sense to create a standard that if complied with and validated by the standards initiative maintainers, a standard could be created. That standard to create standards is called `meta` standard, meta meaning self-referential.

## Create a new standard
Hopefully this initiative get you exited enough to try to create a new standard. Remember that community is very important to make this happen so please give it a try and whatever question that may arise please do not hesitate to contact us on Gitter [Shere](https://gitter.im/standards/Lobby).

Here are the process for which a standard needs to go through to see the light of day and be available on the Standards organization for others to find and apply on their projects:
